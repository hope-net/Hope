        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          <strong className="red-text">
            Hope was created with a singular purpose
          </strong>{" "}
          – to bridge the gap between students and the resources they need for
          academic success. Born out of the vision of graduate students who
          understand the challenges faced by today's learners, our platform is
          dedicated to making quality study materials more accessible. The idea
          is to provide every KTU student with the tools, resources, and support

          videos, previous year question papers, and the official syllabus, all
          in one place. Whether you're in Computer Science, Mechanical Engineering, 
          Civil Engineering, or any other branch, Hope is here
